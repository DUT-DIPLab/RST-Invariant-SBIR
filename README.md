# Introduction

The repository is the codes for [__RST-Invariant Sketch Retrieval Based On Circular Description__](https://github.com/DUT-DIPLab/RST-Invariant-SBIR/files/388/388-ZWBi-141.pdf).

# Abstract

The proposed method utilizes saliency map
and boundary information to detect salient contours for each
image, then uses patch hashing to eliminate the deformations
and redundancies of sketches. To achieve rotational invariance,
we describe salient contours using circular description.
The experiment results on two public datasets demonstrated
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts in
both natural and product images, and handles rotation, scaling
and translation transformations.
